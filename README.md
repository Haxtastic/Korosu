Korosu
======

Korosu is a early alpha of a top-down shooter.  
Basically what I set out to do was building a sandbox for a smartphone game.  

Knowing that controls are what bothered me the most with smartphone games I tried to create controls that felt nice.  

In that regard I believe I succeeded even if the game never got very far.  

On the desktop version you can spawn more enemies by pressing G.  
Pressing H will change weapons if you have picked up any.  

Whole source is a bit messy, code is around two years old and never built to last.
